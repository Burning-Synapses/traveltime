# traveltime
A simple traveltime map made by Maudova, slightly modified.

You set two distances by clicking the start and end positions on the map, and it will display travel times for various vehicles 
The first is an ideal course, the second is a difficult one.

Right Clicking (or, on mobile, holding the click for a second) opens a menu that lets you switch between Kilometers and Miles, as well as change your Essence score (relevant for Cirrus Skiff)


Usage: simply open the html on your browser. It has no outside dependencies.
